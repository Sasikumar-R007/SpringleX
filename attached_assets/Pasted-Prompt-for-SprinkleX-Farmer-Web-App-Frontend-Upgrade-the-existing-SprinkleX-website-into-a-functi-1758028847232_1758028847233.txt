Prompt for SprinkleX Farmer Web App (Frontend)

Upgrade the existing SprinkleX website into a functional farmer web app.

Requirements:

Tech Stack: React + Tailwind CSS

Keep the current landing page (about the device) but add:

Get Started button → opens login/register page

Login button in the navbar (top-right)

Features to Add:

Login & Register System (Frontend Only)

Clean page with two tabs: Login | Register

Register fields: Name, Phone Number, Email, Password

Login fields: Phone/Email, Password

No backend yet — just store login state in localStorage for demo.

Farm Setup Wizard (First-Time User Flow)

After first login, show a step-by-step form:

Step 1: Land Size (number + dropdown acres/hectares)

Step 2: Crop Type (dropdown: rice, wheat, sugarcane, etc.)

Step 3: Soil Type (dropdown: clay, loam, sandy)

Step 4: Crop Count (number input)

Show a progress bar (step 1/4, step 2/4, etc.)

After submission, save this data in localStorage and redirect to dashboard.

Farmer Dashboard

Show a welcome message with farmer name & land details

Display 3–4 zones with:

Moisture level (dummy random values)

Status color: Green (Good), Yellow (Dry), Red (Critical)

Manual control toggle (simulate ON/OFF state)

Alerts section: Recent events (e.g., “Zone 2 watered at 10:15 AM”) – just show dummy data for now

“Edit Farm Details” button → opens setup wizard again

Profile & Settings

Farmer details: Name, Phone, Email (editable)

Language switch: English ↔ Tamil (translate labels/buttons)

Notification preference toggle (SMS on/off – just dummy toggle)

UI Design

Keep it mobile-friendly with large buttons and cards

Use Tailwind’s green theme (#22c55e) for highlights

Sticky navbar with links: Dashboard | Profile | Logout

Add a simple animation for moisture value updates (refresh every few seconds)

Bonus:

Use React Router for page navigation (Landing → Login → Setup → Dashboard)

Use dummy JSON or state variables to simulate:

Farmer data

Zone moisture readings

Alerts (generate every 30 sec)

Use lucide-react icons for dashboard (water drop, alert, settings)
